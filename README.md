# Greenspun

Greenspun's tenth rule of programming is an aphorism in computer programming and especially programming language circles that states:

> Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.

This project aims at providing a reasonable "dynamic" programming facility in Kotlin.

## Examples

- [FizzBuzz](https://github.com/kobjects/greenspun/blob/main/shared/src/commonTest/kotlin/org/kobjects/greenspun/ExecutionTests.kt) implemented in Greenspun
